safify.js
=========


jQuery Safify is a simple jQuery plugin to convert potentially risky HTML to 'safer' HTML based on OWASP and leaves in some minimal, safe HTML. Put another way, it does things like convert `<script>` to `&lt;script&gt;` for on-screen display while leaving safe tags like `<b>` in place.


Introduction
------------

If you're loading HTML from untrusted sources (for example, a comment from a website user) and don't know how clean the HTML is, this plugin is for you.

Here's an easy test to see if your code is currently unsafe.

Insert this into an input field, save it the data, and display the saved HTML in a div (not back in the same textarea or input field):

    <script>  alert(1);  </script>

If you get an alert box, then your code is vulnerable to XSS. Or, put another way, `$(".div").html("<script>alert(1)</script>")` is unsafe, but replacing `html()` with `safify()` will fix it.



How to Use
----------

jQuery Safify is very easy to use! Instead of using $.html, just use $.safify instead.

    var evil = "<h1>Headline</h1><p>This is evil: <script>alert(1);</script></p>";
    $("body").safify(evil);


jQuery Safify relies on pure Javascript methods: `safify()`, `unsafify()`, and `saferify()`:

*   `safify()` escapes HTML according to OWASP standards.

*   `unsafify()` removes that escaping, which is useful before displaying in an input or textarea field (although disable HTML-ified editors', such as MCE, on those input fields since those HTML editors might not be safe.)

*   `saferify()` includes safify but then reverses some safe HTML, such as bold, italics, etc. This is the most useful version generally.
